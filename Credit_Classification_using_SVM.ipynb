        "From the KNN Classification, the accuracy was 72.12%. In logistic regression, the best accuracy was 76.87%. Before, for SVC with RandomSearchCV, we got an accuracy of 76.57%. Here, for SVC with Halving RandomSearchCV, we got an accuracy of 75.56%. For Random Forest, we got an accuracy of 73%. Logistic Regression, Random Forest and SVC outperform KNN Classification. Highest accuracies are seen in SVC and Logistic Regression. There is not that much of a difference between the accuracies them. Since SVC has regularization and margin maximization, I would recommend SVC."
