# Applied-Machine-Learning
Contains projects for Exploratory Data Analysis, different cross validation strategies, classification models, and regression models.

1. Comparison_of_Cross_Validation_methods:
Using iris data set and KNN classification, analyzed prediction accuracies for different cross validation methods: K-fold, Stratified K-fold, and Stratified shuffle split.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch.

3. Credit_Classification_using_KNN:
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on credit-g dataset. Built a KNN classifier for predicting "Good" or "Bad" credit through multiple pipelines for hyperparameter tuning.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch.

4. Linear Regression and Logistic Regression:
  a. For the same goal from "3", implemented using Logistic Regression for credit-g dataset.
  b. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis and implemented Linear Regression on Seol Bike Sharing Demand. Predicted the number of bikes that could be rented on a       particular day.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch.

5. Rented_Bike_Predictor_KNeighbourRegressor:
Implemented KNNeighbours Regression on Seol Bike Sharing Demand. Predicted the number of bikes that could be rented on a particular day.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearch.

6. Credit_Classification_using_SVM_RandomForest:
For the same goal from "3", implemented using SVM and Random Forest. Compared performance of all models - KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest.
Hyperparameter tuning using HalvingRandomSearch.
